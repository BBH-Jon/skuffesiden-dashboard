### ReadMe: Bolig Dashboard

---

#### **Overview**
This project is a **Bolig Dashboard** designed to visualize and analyze property data from multiple databases. It allows users to explore property information interactively, including features like filtering, mapping, and detailed data views.
See it at https://skuffesiden-dashboard.streamlit.app/

#### **Key Features**
1. **Interactive Filters**:
   - Filter by city, property type, number of rooms, energy label, price range, and area size.
   - A "Clear All Filters" button for resetting all selections.

2. **Dynamic Visualizations**:
   - **Map View**: Displays properties on an interactive map based on latitude and longitude.
   - **Top Cities**: A bar chart showing the top 10 cities with the most properties.
   - **Properties by Price per Area**: A visual comparison of property price vs. area.
   - **Monthly Property Creation**: A bar chart showcasing the number of properties added each month.

3. **Detailed Data Overview**:
   - Displays selected columns of property data in a table.
   - Renamed columns for clarity, such as "Price (DKK)" and "Area (mÂ²)."
   - Predefined column order for better readability.

4. **Customizable Data Source**:
   - Reads data from a CSV file (`combined_posts_and_metadata_with_lat_long.csv`) generated by combining property data from multiple databases.
